== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the short-code for this plugin =

`[ank_google_map]`

= Why did you call it Light Weight? =

It utilize WordPress dash-icons, color picker, and text editor on plugin Options Page.<br>
It does not create additional tables in your database, uses inbuilt 'wp_options' table.<br>
The whole package is about 25 kb (zipped).

= What do you mean by Non Bloated? =

There are many of Map plugins in plugin directory, but most of them not written well.<br>
Means they put lots of java script (uncompressed) code on every page of your website.
They also loads jQuery file before them which effects your page speed.
This plugin will enqueue its JS files on the required page only.
It does not depends on external js library like: jQuery.

= Map controls not shown correctly on front-end. =

Add this css code to your theme's style.css file to fix this

`
.gmnoprint img, #agm-canvas img { max-width: none; }

`

= Full screen control not visible. =

This is because of you theme css, test with WP default theme first.

= Shortcode does not work in text widget. =

Add this line to your theme's functions.php
`add_filter( 'widget_text', 'do_shortcode' );`

= Changes does not reflect after saving settings. =

Are you using some Cache/Performance plugin (eg:WP Super Cache/W3 Total Cache) ?
Then flush your WP cache and refresh target page.

WP Database->wp-options->ank_google_map.
Uses a single row, stored in array for faster access.

Every marker image is loaded from official Google Server.
You can also upload your own marker images.

= What if i uninstall/remove this plugin? =

No worry! It will remove its traces from database upon uninstall.
You have to remove short-code from your pages by yourself.

= How do i enter correct language code? =

You can force google to load a specific language for all visitors.<br>
Get latest supported language code list from [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport).
If you don't specify language code then google will try to load the language requested by visitor's web browser.
